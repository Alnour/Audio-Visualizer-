Audio Visulize

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

External Tools are
an FFT algorithm written by Orlando Selenu
I have also used Siri Web view and altered it
so that it can hold different wave forms




## Code Design Concepts

MVP Design Pattern is adopted in this project
each user scenario has its own package which contains a contractor that links the view with presenter.
Then there is a presenter class that implements the presenter interface.
Views are implemented by activites and models are separated in their own package.
Two user stories has been added here : the main story and the settings story.


## Next Feature

Reading streams for audio files and not recording only
